#To set another level of logging use:
# -Djcat.logging=<Level>
# when starting JCAT
# for example -Djcat.logging=debug
# <Level> is a valid log4j level
# Level DEBUG - The DEBUG Level designates fine-grained informational events that are most useful to debug an application. 
# Level INFO - The INFO level designates informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at coarse-grained level. 
# Level WARN - The WARN level designates potentially harmful situations.
# Level ERROR - The ERROR level designates error events that might still allow the application to continue running.
# Level FATAL - The FATAL level designates very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort. 

# In addition, there are two special levels of logging available: (descriptions borrowed from the log4j API http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/api/index.html):

# Level ALL -The ALL Level has the lowest possible rank and is intended to turn on all logging.
# Level OFF - The OFF Level has the highest possible rank and is intended to turn off logging.
log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG, A1

# Special case for the j2ssh implementation, which seems to have log level set to DEBUG by default
log4j.logger.com.sshtools.j2ssh=OFF
log4j.logger.se.ericsson.jcat.fw.utils.Ssh2Session=INFO

# A1 is set to be a ConsoleAppender.
log4j.appender.A1=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
# A1 uses PatternLayout.
log4j.appender.A1.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
#log4j.appender.A1.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ISO8601} %m\n
log4j.appender.A1.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS } %-6p %m  [%t] [%F:%L]%n
# need to set follow = true for the appender as it gets moved around in junit tests
log4j.appender.A1.follow=true
